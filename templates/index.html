            <p>Socrates, born in Athens in the year 470 BCE was a philosopher who is said to be the first to bring philosophy down from the heavens. Meaning that he was the first for practical application.</p>
            <p>Greatest Quote: Socrates is special because the most important thing we learn from him is to think crtically not be like a sophist relying heavily on quotes or mantras. However his greatest quote is "The unexamined life is not worth living".</p>

        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p>The <strong>AI Philosophy Project</strong> was born from my lifelong fascination with philosophy and my want to bring these philosophers to life. From the wisdom of the Stoics to the rational dialogues of the Greeks, I’ve always believed philosophy gives us a foundation for understanding life and decision-making. I wanted to recreate those timeless exchanges in a way that anyone could experience, not just by reading, but by conversing with the thinkers themselves.</p>
        <p>This project was developed using <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Flask</strong> for the backend, integrating <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> for the interface. The intelligence behind the dialogues is powered by <strong>OpenAI’s API</strong>, giving each philosopher their own authentic reasoning style and tone. </p>
        <p>I really hope that you enjoy using this project as much as I did making it, it mixed two of my greatest passions, philosophy and software engineering, two disciplines that advance humanity in their own way.</p>

          <h2>From soldier and stonemason to relentless examiner</h2>
          <p class="lead">Born to Sophroniscus (a stonemason) and Phaenarete (a midwife), Socrates grew up in working-class Athens. He served as a hoplite in three campaigns (Potidaea, Delium, Amphipolis), earning a reputation for courage and endurance. The turning point came when the Delphic oracle, through his friend Chaerephon, declared that no one was wiser than Socrates. He didn’t believe it and set out to test it.</p>
          <p>Interviewing statesmen, poets, and craftsmen, he discovered a pattern: people spoke confidently without being able to define their key terms or defend their assumptions. That realization shaped his life’s work, not to preach a doctrine, but to practice a method of honest questioning in public.</p>

          <h2>Elenchus: a method that makes beliefs earn their keep</h2>
          <p>Socrates used short, precise questions to expose contradictions and push ideas to their logical end (<em>elenchus</em>). The aim was not humiliation but clarity: refine the claim until it fits reality or drop it. That’s why Socrates left no treatises; the method <em>is</em> the message.</p>

          <h2>The trial, the escape plan, and the hemlock (399 BCE)</h2>
          <p>Accused of impiety and corrupting the youth, Socrates defended his mission: awaken Athens to care for virtue over reputation. After conviction, friends arranged an escape, but he refused. In Plato’s <em>Crito</em>, Socrates argues that breaking the law would harm the very city he seeks to improve. He chose to obey the verdict and calmly drank hemlock among friends. Courage without bitterness became his final lesson.</p>

          <h2>Habits to practice this week</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Define the key word</strong> (e.g., “success,” “fair,” “risk”) before debating it.</li>
            <li><strong>Ask for the assumption</strong> behind each claim: “What must be true for this to work?”</li>
            <li><strong>Trace consequences</strong> two steps out; note contradictions quickly.</li>
            <li><strong>Prefer truth to pride</strong>: when the facts change, say “I was wrong” and adjust.</li>

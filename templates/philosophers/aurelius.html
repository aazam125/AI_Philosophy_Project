          <h2>Power, plague, and a private workbook</h2>
          <p class="lead">Born in Rome, Marcus was adopted at 17 by Antoninus Pius at Emperor Hadrian’s request (138 CE). He became co-emperor in 161 CE. His reign was marked by the Parthian War, the Antonine Plague (beginning c. 165 CE), and the long Marcomannic Wars along the Danube. In campaign tents near Carnuntum, he wrote personal notes to steady his character, later known as <em>Meditations</em>.</p>
          <p>He did not choose an easy philosophy to look wise; he chose a hard discipline to stay decent: attention to judgments, honesty about duty, and service to the common good even when outcomes were grim.</p>

          <h2>Discipline of perception, action, and will</h2>
          <p>Stoicism treats events as neutral; our judgments make them torment or training. Separate what’s up to you (judgments, choices) from what isn’t (reputation, weather, other people). Then do the next just, courageous, and prudent thing. Return your attention to the present task; let outcomes land where they must.</p>

          <h2>The emperor who sold the palace silver</h2>
          <p>During the crises of his reign, sources report Marcus auctioned palace treasures to fund the army and relief (a striking reversal of imperial vanity). He wrote about greeting each day’s “ungrateful, arrogant, deceitful” people without anger because they are kin in reason. Power didn’t spare him hardship; philosophy taught him how to carry it.</p>

          <h2>Daily practices that travel</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Separate fact from story:</strong> “What part of this is under my control?”</li>
            <li><strong>Choose the next right action:</strong> small, just steps compound under pressure.</li>
            <li><strong>Re-center often:</strong> when jarred, return attention to the work at hand.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve the common good:</strong> it clarifies priorities and quiets ego.</li>

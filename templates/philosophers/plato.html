          <h2>From disillusion to design</h2>
          <p class="lead">Born into an Athenian aristocratic family, Plato witnessed the Peloponnesian War and the instability that followed. The execution of his teacher Socrates (399 BCE) was decisive: rhetoric detached from truth can ruin a city. Plato traveled to Egypt and Southern Italy, studied with Pythagoreans, and returned to found the Academy (c. 387 BCE), the first enduring institution of higher learning in the West.</p>
          <p>He also attempted political reform in Syracuse, advising Dion and the young Dionysius II. The project failed, deepening his conviction that education of character must precede power, otherwise institutions become tools of appetite.</p>

          <h2>Structure as a tool for the good</h2>
          <p>In dialogues like the <em>Republic</em>, Plato argues that truth is not whatever persuades today; it aims at what is stable — “the form of the good.” In the soul, reason should guide spirit (our drive) and appetite (our urges). In the city, roles and laws should align with virtue so each part does work it is fitted to do. When parts are ordered to purpose, the whole becomes just.</p>

          <h2>The Allegory of the Cave</h2>
          <p>Prisoners chained in a cave mistake shadows for reality. One is freed, painfully turns toward the light, and finally sees the sun, the source of truth. When he returns to help the others, they mock him. The lesson: education begins with discomfort; the task of the thinker is to turn around and then turn back to serve.</p>

          <h2>Design decisions that hold under pressure</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Name the good:</strong> write a crisp description of success before you optimize.</li>
            <li><strong>Align incentives:</strong> make the just behavior also the rewarding behavior.</li>
            <li><strong>Order the parts:</strong> let principles steer energy; keep appetites in check.</li>
            <li><strong>Educate for character:</strong> skill without virtue scales damage.</li>
